## Abstract

This paper reports findings from an experiment in 120 Indian villages on three approaches to survey training and their impact on data quality: agentic-feedback training (AFT), where interviewers received autonomy-supportive feedback that encouraged reflection and ownership; retesting approach to training (RTA), where interviewers reinforced learning through repeated testing; and the standard restudying approach (RSA). Training interviewers using informative suggestions and feedback designed to strengthen agency, the AFT performed better in reducing outliers, missing values, and section or variable skips compared to RTA and RSA. Specifically, AFT reduced the likelihood of at least one data quality flag per survey by 36.6%, invalid missing responses by 55.3 (relative to a control group mean of 1,217), and valid skips by 76.25 (relative to a control group mean of 1,665). The improvements were driven by reductions in interviewer effects, enhanced ownership of surveys, and better on-field problem-solving. Cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrates that AFT offered significant improvements in data quality relative to expenditure, outperforming the alternatives. These findings contribute to survey methodology by highlighting the role of agentic training in enhancing data integrity in large-scale field studies.
