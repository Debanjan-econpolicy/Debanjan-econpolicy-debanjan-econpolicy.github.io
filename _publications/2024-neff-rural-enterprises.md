## Abstract

This study investigates how alleviating liquidity constraints influences the production function and performance of rural nano enterprises operating in informal markets. Using a natural experiment that provided exogenous variation in access to formal credit among small, hyperlocal firms, we analyze enterprise-level data from 2,576 firms across 208 villages in Tamil Nadu. Our difference-in-differences framework exploits quasi-random allocation of credit support to identify causal impacts on firm outcomes. 

We find that improved credit access leads to significant increases in profits (0.149 standard deviations) and revenues (0.117 SD), without proportional cost escalation, indicating gains in production efficiency. Firms respond by reallocating capital toward fewer, larger investments (0.298 SD increase in total investment) and prioritizing working capital (0.156 SD), which appears to have been the binding constraint on output. We also document substantial improvements in record-keeping (2.5 SD), suggesting enhanced managerial inputs into the production process, although effects on marketing and customer credit practices are more complex. 

Our findings advance understanding of how informal firms adjust production decisions when liquidity constraints are relaxed and highlight the central role of working capital in driving efficiency gains among small enterprises in low-income settings.
