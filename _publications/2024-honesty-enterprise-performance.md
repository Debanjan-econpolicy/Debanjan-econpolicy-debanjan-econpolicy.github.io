## Abstract

This study examines whether honesty influences enterprise performance in informal markets, where nano-entrepreneurs operate under conditions of weak formal enforcement and thin margins. We conceptualize profitability as a function of both tangible inputs and intangible factorsâ€”particularly honesty, which may reduce transaction costs and build trust-based relationships. To identify the causal impact of honesty on firm outcomes, we designed a novel field experiment involving 2,576 nano-enterprises across 208 villages in Tamil Nadu. 

Rather than attempting to directly measure latent honesty, we randomized exposure to opportunities for dishonest behavior using a mathematics task that mimicked daily business calculations. Villages were assigned to either a treatment arm, where self-reported performance was tied to monetary rewards, or a control arm, where no payments were offered. This variation generated exogenous differences in dishonest behavior, which we exploited using an instrumental variable approach.

Our findings show that honesty significantly improves enterprise profitability and revenue, driven by both lower transaction costs and enhanced supplier and customer trust. Firms that demonstrated greater honesty secured better trade terms, reduced monitoring requirements, and experienced stronger customer loyalty. The study provides new evidence that honesty acts as a price-discriminating factor in competitive informal markets, enabling entrepreneurs to differentiate themselves and achieve sustainable advantages. Our design contributes a scalable method for isolating the role of honesty in production decisions and highlights the importance of transparency as a determinant of small firm success.
