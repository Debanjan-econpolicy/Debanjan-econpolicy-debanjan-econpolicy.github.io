## Abstract

This study investigates how conditional loan subsidies, paired with managerial training, affect production choices and performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) operating in credit-constrained rural markets. We exploit quasi-experimental variation generated by administrative rejections unrelated to firm fundamentals—such as documentation errors, procedural lapses, or technical glitches—alongside staggered rollout of support across seven quarterly cohorts in Tamil Nadu between 2022 and 2024. This dual-source natural experiment allows us to identify the causal effects of relaxing both financial and managerial constraints on firm production functions. 

Using matched data for 3,000 enterprises (1,500 treated, 1,500 control) and a staggered difference-in-differences framework, we find that alleviating constraints significantly enhances firm survival (39–40% higher survival rates), increases revenue (11.4%), and boosts profits (up to 17.9% in early cohorts). Firms shift their production strategies by making larger, more strategic investments—average investment sizes rise by 57% and asset creation investments increase by 90%—while maintaining cost efficiency. Training modestly improves business practices (2.8%), mainly through better record-keeping (4.4%). 

The findings show how well-structured incentives can address market failures and enable SMEs to scale production and reoptimize input use in challenging environments.
