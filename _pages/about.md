**Debanjan Das**

Ph.D. Candidate in Development Economics

Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA), India

I will be on the 2025-2026 academic job market, but I'm also happy to discuss industry and policy roles anytime.

I would be more than willing to relocate globally and am particularly interested in opportunities in academic institutions, policy organizations, and development agencies.

My academic work/projects can be found **here**.

## About me

My research sits at the intersection of **public policy and development economics**, with a particular focus on enterprise development and financial inclusion. I am especially interested in how targeted interventions can help micro and nano enterprises—particularly those operating in informal markets—grow, formalize, and become more resilient. My work engages directly with community-based institutions and rural entrepreneurs, exploring how well-designed programs can address the structural constraints that limit enterprise growth in developing countries.

I approach these questions using field experiments and quasi-experimental designs, always with an eye toward improving both program effectiveness and the empirical methods we use to evaluate them.

Beyond enterprise development, I am deeply interested in **survey methodology**—particularly in developing innovative interviewer training approaches that enhance data quality in large-scale household surveys. This methodological work complements my substantive research by ensuring that our evidence base is as robust as possible.

My research interests also extend to **agricultural economics** and rural transformation. Drawing on my background in agricultural extension, I examine how agricultural interventions and integrated farming systems can complement enterprise development initiatives. This broader perspective on rural economic systems helps me understand the complex environment in which many nano enterprises operate across India's diverse agro-climatic zones.

I enjoy bridging complex field realities with rigorous empirical analysis, incorporating behavioral insights into program design, and translating research findings into clear, policy-relevant evidence. I have a particular passion for causal inference methods, applied econometrics, and machine learning applications in development research.

Proponent of **#CausalInference** and evidence-based policymaking.
