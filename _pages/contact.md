I am a chronically online person, so you can email me at **f2101@irma.ac.in** at anytime, and I will reply to you straight away (unless it is about a subject that requires a lot of thinking).

Feel free to reach out about research collaborations, academic opportunities, or anything related to causal inference, development economics and public policy!
